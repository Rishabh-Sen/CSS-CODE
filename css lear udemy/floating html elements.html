				 Hi, dear reader. If you use Wikipedia a lot, this message is for you. We're sure you are busy so we'll make this quick: this Saturday we need your help. We don't have salespeople. We depend on donations from exceptional readers, but fewer than 2% give. If you donate just â‚¹ 75, or whatever you can this Saturday, Wikipedia could keep thriving. Thank you.
